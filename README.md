# Student Admission Predictor

This repository contains a machine learning-based project developed to predict student admission probabilities based on GRE, TOEFL scores, and other academic factors.

## Project Overview

Using historical data on student profiles and their admission outcomes, we've developed a predictive model that offers insights to prospective students on their chances of securing an admission.

## Features

- *Data Collection*: Collection of data points like GRE, TOEFL scores, and other relevant academic factors.
- *Data Processing*: Pre-processing and cleaning of the data to ensure accuracy.
- *Model Development*: Implemented a  Random Forest regression and Liner regression model using Python.
- *Prediction & Validation*: The model provides an admission prediction and was validated against a test dataset achieving a [specific accuracy, e.g., "92%"] accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- *Language*: Python
- *Libraries*:  scikit-learn, pandas, numpy.

## Results

The model achieved a 98% accuracy in predicting student admission outcomes based on the test dataset.
